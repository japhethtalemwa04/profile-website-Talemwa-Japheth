          <p>
I am a passionate Computer Science professional with a strong foundation in programming, 
networking, and database management. Over the past few years, I have gained valuable 
experience through academic training and hands-on internships where I worked on IT systems 
support, software development, and data management. I enjoy exploring new technologies, 
analyzing problems, and developing innovative solutions that improve efficiency and create 
real-world impact. My goal is to continuously grow my technical skills while contributing to 
projects that make a difference in organizations and communities. With strong values of 
integrity, teamwork, and innovation, I believe in using technology not only as a career path 
but also as a tool for positive change.
